but before that us need to install 'yt-dlp.exe' using `pip install yt-dlp` require python and pip installed !!!

      then when all files are downloaded u need to update the python file 'path name of : input folder / output folder / and the ffmpeg.exe that exist in the .zip file `path/to/bin/.../.fmpeg.exe`
